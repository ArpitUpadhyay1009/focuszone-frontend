  - For subscribed users: Routes to subscription management page

## User Flow

### 1. After Login (Authenticated Users)

1. User logs in successfully
2. System checks subscription status via API
3. If not subscribed and haven't seen modal before:
   - Wait 3 seconds
   - Show newsletter subscription modal
   - Store flag in localStorage to prevent repeated showing

### 2. Footer Link Click

1. **Non-authenticated users**: Navigate to newsletter landing page
2. **Authenticated unsubscribed users**: Show subscription modal
3. **Authenticated subscribed users**: Navigate to subscription management page

### 3. Newsletter Management

1. Authenticated users can visit `/newsletter` to view their subscription status
2. Can see subscription details (email, date)
3. Can unsubscribe with confirmation dialog
4. Page updates status in real-time

## API Integration

The frontend integrates with the following backend endpoints:

- `POST /api/newsletter/subscribe` - Subscribe to newsletter
- `POST /api/newsletter/unsubscribe` - Unsubscribe from newsletter
- `GET /api/newsletter/status` - Get subscription status

All API calls include proper error handling and loading states.

## Styling & Responsiveness

- All components use CSS custom properties for theming
- Support for both light and dark modes
- Fully responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Consistent design language with the rest of the application
- Loading spinners and smooth transitions
